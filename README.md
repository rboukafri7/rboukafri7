# Hey, I am Redu! :grin:
I am from Barcelona and I have studied **Mathematics** and **Physics**, and currently I am doing the **MSc in Statistics** at **Imperial**. 

Outside of Statistics I have different hobbies:
- Watching _films_. You can check my [Letterbox](https://letterboxd.com/redu_1/).
- Listening to _music_. You can follow me on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/m73proio7oqnekpi8y9jfz2hz?si=d6f765d8a7524875)
- Doing _calisthenics_ and going to the _gym_.
